- [ ] Backend `.env` file configured with API keys
- [ ] Frontend `.env` file configured
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm run setup` from root)

---

## Backend Tests

### Server Startup
- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- [ ] See "âœ… MongoDB connected successfully"
- [ ] See "âœ… Redis connected successfully" (or warning if Redis not available)
- [ ] See "ðŸŒ¸ WaifUwU Backend Server ðŸŒ¸"
- [ ] Server running on port 4000

### Health Check
- [ ] Open browser: `http://localhost:4000/health`
- [ ] See JSON response: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","service":"WaifUwU Backend"}`

### API Endpoints (Manual Test)

**Test Chat Message:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"message\":\"Hello!\"}"
```

Expected response:
- [ ] Contains `sessionId`

- [ ] Contains `emotion` (Idle/Talking/Shy/Angry/Greeting)
- [ ] Contains `audioUrl` (base64 data or null)
- [ ] Contains `duration` (number)
- [ ] Contains `messageId`

**Test New Conversation:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/chat/new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected:
- [ ] Returns new `sessionId`
- [ ] Returns initial greeting message

### Database Verification

**MongoDB:**
```bash
mongosh
use ai-talking-robot
db.conversations.find().pretty()
```

- [ ] See conversation documents
- [ ] Messages array contains user and assistant messages
- [ ] Timestamps are correct

**Redis (if running):**
```bash
redis-cli
KEYS *
GET conversation:[session-id]
```

- [ ] See cached conversation keys
- [ ] Cached data is valid JSON
